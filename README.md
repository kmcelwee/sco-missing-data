# Estimating missing data in the Shakespeare & Company dataset

In order to estimate missing data in the Shakespeare & Company dataset, we divide the dataset into four categories:

* [Books](books.ipynb): The books in the dataset.
* [Members](members.ipynb): Shakespeare & Company community members.
* [Book Activity](book-activity.ipynb): Events in the dataset that concern members' interaction with books.
* [Membership Activity](membership-activity.ipynb): Events in the dataset that concern members' subscription and other payment information.

The dataset is known to be incomplete and the four notebooks walk through processes to estimate the proportion of missing data in each category.
